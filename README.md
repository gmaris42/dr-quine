# Dr-Quine
## Projet Dr-Quine | Self-replication | 42 Paris | 42 Network | C | ASM
### Description:<br>
* This small algo project will get you acquainted with auto-replication problems and confront the Kleene recursion theorem. 
<br>
A quine is a computer program (a kind of metaprogram) whose output and source
code are identical. As a challenge or for fun, some programmers try to write the shortest
quine in a given programming language.<br><br>

The operation that consist of simply opening the source file and displaying it is considered cheating. <br>
More generally, a program that uses any data entry cannot be considereda valid quine.<br>
A trivial solution is a program whose source code is empty.<br>
Indeed, the execution of such a program produces for most languages no output, that is to say the source code of the program.
